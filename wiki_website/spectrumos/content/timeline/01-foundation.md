The National Startup Awards celebrated its tenth anniversary this year. Helgen Technologies sets the bar for intelligent autonomous systems by taking silver in the "**Emerge Tech Startup**" category.

The National Startup awards acknowledge early-stage companies by providing them with an opportunity to gain national and international recognition from other companies and potential investors.

The start-up specializes in the complex retrofitting of heavy equipment to convert into autonomous systems, which will be utilized in different verticals, such as mining and waste industries. **Helgen Technologies is on a mission to bring automation to the right place.**

Helgen enables sites to operate at higher standards by **increasing productivity**, **reducing risk**, **improving KPIs**, **bettering safety**, whilst being **compatible** with multiple types of machines.

The diverse company began developing earlier this year. The idea was formulated in a garage in Limerick by a group of experts in Robotics. Helgen was officially launched in May 2021. The company has been exponentially growing since.

Helgen Technologies was one of many winners during the National Awards presentation, streamed live on the internet (2 December). Enterprise Ireland, Microfinance Ireland, Sage, Cronin Accountants, and McCann Fitzgerald sponsored the event.

The prestigious corporate law firm**, McCann Fitzgerald,**  sponsored the Emerge Tech Startup category. Helgen was nominated amongst other companies such as LiveCosts.com and Xunison.
